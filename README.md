## html5-project

A front-end project template using Gulp and Webpack.

Gulp allows you to write your build in JavaScript code rather than a JSON config.  I have chosen to use CoffeeScript because it is concise.  If you want to use plain JavaScript, you can easily do so:

```
coffee -p gulpfile.coffee > gulpfile.js
```

###Features

 * HTML and Markdown pages with layout
 * CSS processing with PostCSS and TailwindCSS
 * Javascript bundling using Webpack (config inside gulpfile)
 * Hot reloading development server
